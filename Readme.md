This is a collection of my personal development tips and tricks. This is a work in progress and subject to change. My goal is to create a wiki where I can keep track of what works for me. In an ideal world, others would fork this project and add their own tips and experimentation, and sometimes also send pull requests when they see something that could be improved.

This is a work in progress. It's not intended to be consumed just yet ;)

### Productivity system

I try to follow the GTD system. I use instapaper to save pages that I
want to read later. I also have an inbox folder in my Desktop where I
throw all the studd that I don't know where to put next.

I constantly empty those spaces.

I recently started to use Things again. Things is great because it
allows me to create repeating tasks and organize projects. It's also
good for writing down quick ideas. Sometimes I send ideas to my email
address and then move them to Things once I'm back at my workstation.
Always keep inbox to 0. That's very important.

### Knowing what to do

The 80/20 rule of productivity is knowing what to do.

In Things, I keep three general projects which represents the main ares
where I'm working right now: Learning, Consulting, and Fructivity
(Fructivity is my company).

Inside each of those three main projects I list all the sub projects
that I want to work on regarding that area. So for example under
Fructivity I may have [Color Picker Pro](https://github.com/oscardelben/Color-Picker-Pro) and other projects related to my company.

I try to work on only one project per main area at a time. The first
item in each main project represents what I'm working on right now, and
I usually create a specific project in Things just for those projects
that I'm working on right now. I don't try to order the remaining items
though, I just pick what I believe to be most important every time that
I finish a project.

Finally, I keep two other projects in Things: someday/maybe, and Waiting
for. In sometimes/maybe I also keep tasks that I have to do for projects
that are not yet started.

### Room for improvement

There is lots of room for improvements. First thing that comes to mind
is a proper tracking system. What did you do today? How are projects
going overall? How are expenses.
