This is a collection of my personal development tips and tricks. This is a work in progress and subject to change. My goal is to create a wiki where I can keep track of what works for me. In an ideal world, others would fork this project and add their own tips and experimentation, and sometimes also send pull requests when they see something that could be improved.

TODO:

*  Experimenting, not yet sure wherever it'll work or not
