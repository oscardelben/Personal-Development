Top level ideas:

- What you do is orders of magnitude more important than how you do it. So choose your activities wisely.
- Always be doing the most important task in your list. Worse scenario you'll soon hire an assistant for the small, secondary tasks.
- Focus on filling the needs at your company.
- Pay attention to details of your work. Be professional.
- Don't say "No". Say "Yes, but doing that will cost you...". Thanks edw519 for this tip.

Techniques:

- Use a standing desk**
- Don't think in front of a computer. Go to the computer only when you know exactly what you're going to do. Do your thinking away from the computer.
- Have a todo list on paper where you can sketch out ideas very quickly.
- Keep pen and paper always with you and on your desk.
- Don't start your day browsing the internet or checking the emails. Start your day either by working on the tasks that are in your todo list or brainstorming activities for the day.
- Schedule time for secondary activities like checking email, facebook, etc.
- If you are procrastinating about a task, break it down into smaller steps, describe how you would approach it.
