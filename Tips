- Doing the right tasks is more important than doing your tasks efficiently. In fact, too much concern for efficiency is a leading cause of procrastination. Say "no" more often, and use your time for tasks that really matter.
- Delegate responsibility as often as possible. Throw away unimportant tasks and items.
- Keep a record of your time use. (Quantified Self can help.)
- Write down your goals. Break them down into smaller goals, and break these into manageable tasks. Schedule these tasks into your calendar.
- Process notes and emails only once. Tackle one task at a time, and group similar tasks together.
- Make use of your downtime (plane rides, bus rides, doctor's office waitings). These days, many of your tasks can be completed on your smartphone.

Procrastination formula http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/

Motivation = Expectancy * Value / Impulsiveness * Delay

Techniques:

- Use the pomodoro technique
- Use a standing desk**
- Don't think in front of a computer. Go to the computer only when you know exactly what you're going to do. Do your thinking away from the computer.
- Have a todo list on paper where you can sketch out ideas very quickly.
- Keep pen and paper always with you and on your desk.
- Don't start your day browsing the internet or checking the emails. Start your day either by working on the tasks that are in your todo list or brainstorming activities for the day.
- Schedule time for secondary activities like checking email, facebook, etc.
- If you are procrastinating about a task, break it down into smaller steps, describe how you would approach it.
